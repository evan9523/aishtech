- Any folder to be read, by default is read by 'index' file regardless of its type (js, html..);

- Why is a separate css file recommended? Because to read a complete html file for the system with css and html increases weight and decreases performance.
- Why a different folder is required for assets ? Because the files have to have 'relative paths'.

- Every single module is called a component

- Any styling that we want to be strictly applied, we must add importnant to that
